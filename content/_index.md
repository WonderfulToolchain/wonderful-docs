# Welcome!

The Wonderful Toolchain is an assortment of development toolchains for a variety of retro and/or embedded platforms, with particular focus on console homebrew development - though really, it's all about whatever scratches an itch on a given day.

If you'd like to try it out and/or learn more, why don't we [get started](/docs/getting-started)? Feel free to also check out [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/CR7MCZNurp)!

## Targets

* **[wswan](/docs/target/wswan)**: WonderSwan - functional, but not fully polished
* **[wwitch](/docs/target/wswan#wonderwitch)**: [WonderWitch](http://wonderwitch.qute.co.jp/) - preliminary, but functional

*This list is incomplete. [You can help by expanding it.](https://github.com/WonderfulToolchain)*

## Third-party toolchains

As a courtesy, this project also provides builds of some other toolchains:

* **[BlocksDS](https://github.com/blocksds/sdk)**, targetting the NDS/DSi

## Goals

As this is a hobby project, I believe I can afford myself just a little bit of creative writing:

I, for one, believe in the catgirl who cleans windows; with a beautiful, passionately glowing halo,
and wings that stretch out of the reach of one's imagination. Maybe she's misunderstood; maybe she's
a little stubborn; maybe she doesn't always get it right; and yet! Within that brief
moment of passion, that glimmer of joy, she may well be the happiest angel in the world.

*Chasing the absurd is its own delight - we're the puppeteers' coven, dancing with hardware gone by.*

*To homebrew is to gather, to share, to try and understand, to find a spark of curious, loving care.*

*Well then! Are you coming with us? Let's try things together! Let's see what awaits beyond.*
